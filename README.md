## (Teorija kodiranja in kriptografija)

Homework for course Coding theory and cryptography at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in 2018/19.


## Course content overview

1. Coding theory:
  - information and entropy,
  - Shannon theory,
  - error correcting codes,
  - upper bounds for number of words,
  - linear, Hamming, cyclic and Reed-Muller codes.

2. Cryptography:
  - classic cryptography,
  - private key systems,
  - RSA and public key systems,
  - digital signature,
  - hash functions,
  - key distribution and exchange,
  - identification, checking and exchange of secrets,
  - generating pseudo-random numbers,
  - zero information proofs.


## Homework overview

1. Cypher and Decypher:
  - we construct *Encrypt* and *Decrypt* functions to transform input text,
  - with some previous knowledge we use Hill cypher to decypher given text,
  - for similar task we then use Viginer cypher to decrypt given text,
  - we learn that if the cencrypt proces is done naively then attacker has viable chanches to decrypt our "secret" text.
  
2. Geffe generator:
  - we construct a Geffe generator and its advanced version,
  - then we decrypt given text.

3. DSA generator:
  - we use SHA-1 generator to search for collisions,
  - then we use our knowledge to find such collisions with DSA key,
  - finally we find two sequences that produce equal output.
