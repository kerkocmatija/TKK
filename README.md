# CODING THEORY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
# (Teorija kodiranja in kriptografija)

Homework for course Coding theory and cryptography at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in 2018/19.

## Homework overview

1. Cypher and Decypher:
  - we construct *Encrypt* and *Decrypt* functions to transform input text,
  - with some previous knowledge we use Hill cypher to decypher given text,
  - for similar task we then use Viginer cypher to decypher given text,
  - we learn that if the cencrypt proces is done naively then attacker has viable chanches to decypher our "secret" text.
